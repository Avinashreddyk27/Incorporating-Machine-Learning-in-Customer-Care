# Incorporating Machine Learning in Customer Service

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing customer service by integrating Machine Learning (ML) techniques. A local AI chatbot was developed using the **LLaMA model**, enabling efficient query resolution, product comparisons, and processing of product manuals.

## Key Features
- **AI Chatbot Development**: Leveraged the LLaMA model to create a chatbot capable of handling diverse customer service tasks.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensured data security by adopting on-premise solutions, eliminating reliance on external servers.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimized expenses by utilizing open-source tools such as:
  - [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/): For document parsing.
  - [PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf2): For PDF processing.
- **Scalability**: Designed the system to be scalable and adaptable to future requirements.

## Challenges Addressed
1. **Slow Response Times**: Improved system performance by optimizing NLP integration.
2. **Data Privacy Concerns**: Implemented an on-premise solution to avoid external data storage.
3. **High Costs**: Used open-source tools to keep the development budget manageable.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Language Model**: LLaMA
- **Open-Source Libraries**: Apache Tika, PyPDF2
- **Programming Language**: Python

## Learnings
This project provided hands-on experience in:
- AI development and deployment.
- Integration of NLP techniques for practical applications.
- Creating scalable, cost-effective ML solutions for real-world challenges.
